Cybersecurity Capping Game Project

Cryptography minigame - user gets to learn how a caesar cipher works, solves their own, learns difference between caesar and rot13 to solve their own

Use right/up arrow and left/down arrow to rotate the wheel to aid with determining the key

Caesar Cipher
Stage 1 - determine key number given the plaintext and ciphertext
Stage 2 - determine the plaintext given the key and ciphertext
Stage 3 - determine the ciphertext given the key and plaintext

ROT13
Stage 4 - determine the plaintext given the ciphertext and key of 13
Stage 5 - determine the ciphertext given the plaintext and key of 13
